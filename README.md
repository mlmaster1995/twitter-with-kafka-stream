### About The Project
I. This is a small project to leverage the benefits of Apache Kafka realizing the stateful processing and the direct storage via ```Kafka Stream```, ```Kafka Connect``` 
and ```Kafka Producer, Consumer API```. 
  

II. Different from [ETL(Extract Transform Load) Data Pipeline Collection OOP](https://github.com/mlmaster1995/Flume_Kafka_StructureStream_ELT_Updated) project, this project 
  is not a combination of multiple point-to-point data pipelines, BUT a tweet stream pipeline based on ```Lambda Architecture``` which includes the batch layer, and the real-time 
  stateful processing layer for further down-stream process in the serving layer. 
  

III. The batch layer uses ```Kafka HDFS Connect``` and ```Confluent Schema Registry``` ingesting tweet stream with ```Avro Schema``` into ```Hadoop system``` directly. The same stream source
  is processed based on the user-defined topics with ```Json Schema``` via ```Kafka Stream``` saving the data into ```Cassandra database```. 
  

VI. The 2nd upgrade comparing to the [previous project](https://github.com/mlmaster1995/Flume_Kafka_StructureStream_ELT_Updated), this project is developed as an OOP in Java and 
the compiled jar files of different component of the pipeline are generated. All properties related to the pipeline could be configured via a property file and it's easy to reuse the pipeline
in any configured big data environment. 

VII. This project is developed and tested in the self-configured VM with related technologies as [Built With](#built-with). 

### Built With
* [Apache Kafka 2.7.0](https://kafka.apache.org/0102/documentation.html)
* [Apache Hadoop 2.7.7](https://hadoop.apache.org/)
* [Confluent Schema Registry (Community Platform 6.1.0)](https://github.com/confluentinc/schema-registry)
* [Twitter4j 4.0.7](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html)
* [Cassandra 3.11](https://cassandra.apache.org/)

### Pipelines
    
#### Pipeline Structure:

![tweet-stream-kafka](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55723894/112486281-1ee39c80-8d52-11eb-80ce-c51c2b9ad798.jpeg)

#### Pipeline Layers:
* Data source Layer: the tweet data is extracted via the twitter stream API with the specific configs for the language and key words tracking, which could be set up in the 
  ```tweet-message-trending-pipeline.properties```. The default langage is ```english``` and default keywords are the 2021 trending technologies including ```5G,IoB,DevSecOps,
  Intelligent Process Automation,Tactile Virtual Reality,Big Data Analytics,CyberSecurity, Artificial Intelligence```. The tweet stream is ingested into two producers and messages 
  are published to the kafka cluster with both Avro and Json schemas.
  

* Batch Layer: the kafka cluster redirects messages based on the topics into Kakfa Connenct for HDFS storage and Kafka Stream for the stateful processing. The HDFS stores the original data with avro format which
  could be fetched via Spark SQL or Spark Structured API for batch process in the serving layer (Not included in the repo). 
  

* Speed Layer: the stateful process is using a hopping window with custom-defined window size, default at 2min to aggregate the messages with related keywords into a ```related topic count``` which could reflect
the popularity of the trending technology in the tweet. The processed data is saved into Cassandra database which could be extracted and processed in the servering layer (Not included in the repo).
  

* Serving Layer: Not included in this project repo.

#### Use Pipeline:
1. "vmstat stream" is managed by Flume. Check and run ```./start-vmstats-with-flume.sh``` to stream the data and ingest into kafka producer.
   
2. "twitter stream" is managed by TwitterStreamToKafkaProducer app. To set up Twitter api credentials or modify kafka producer props, check ```ApplicationProperties.scala``` in the main folder
in the application folder and then run ```sbt assembly``` to generate the fat jar file ```Twitter_Stream_Source-assembly-0.1.jar```. Finally run ```./start-tweetStream-to-kafkaProducer.sh``` in 
the terminal to stream the data and ingest into kafka producer.

3. "covid19 batch data" is managed by Apache Airflow. Copy ```covid19_data_pipeline.py``` in the Covid19ToKafkaProducer to the dags folder and config ```http connection``` in the airflow webUI and
then trigger the pipeline to collect data and ingest into kafka producer.

4. "kafka consumer sink" is managed by KafkaConsumer app. To modify kafka consumer props, check ```ApplicationProperties.scala``` in the main folder in the application folder and run. 
```sbt assembly``` to generate the fat jar file ```KafkaConsumer-assembly-0.1.jar``` and then run ```./start-kafkaConsumer.sh``` in the terminal to start the consumer.

5. "spark data pipeline" is managed by the property file ```kafka-spark-unit.properties``` and it has all properties for all sinks (console, hdfs, hive table, kafka producer, mongoDB, mySQL) and 
options to select which pipeline to run. All jars are in the ```jars folder``` including dependencies. After config the ```kafka-spark-unit.properties``` file, 
run ```./start-spark-kafka-unit.sh ./kafka-spark-unit.properties``` to in the terminal to start the pipeline.
